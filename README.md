# Animal Race Game 🏁

**Animal Race Game** is a dynamic strategy and competition game developed in Java. The game allows users to manage animal races in various environments (land, water, and air) with a rich graphical interface and real-time score management.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To manage competitive races between animals, incorporating an interactive graphical interface for an engaging and dynamic user experience.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Manage races and visually display competing animals.
- **Support for Multiple Race Types:** Land, water, and air competitions.
- **Animal and Competition Management:** The system enforces rules, such as creating animals only for existing competitions and requiring a minimum of two participants per race.
- **Energy Management:** Each animal has energy that must be replenished by feeding during the race.
- **Scoreboard Management:** Organized display of race results and competition data.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **Swing**: For creating the graphical interface.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** To efficiently manage classes and functionality.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Run the Program:** Launch the application to open the main graphical window.
2. **Create a Competition:** Start by selecting the type of competition (land, water, or air).
3. **Add Animals:** Add animals suitable for the selected competition type.
   - You cannot add animals to competitions that have not been created yet.
4. **Start the Race:** Ensure a minimum of two animals are in the competition to begin the race.
5. **Energy Management:** Feed animals when their energy runs out to keep them moving during the race.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is divided into well-organized packages for clarity:
- **`animals`**: Contains classes for different types of animals (e.g., `Cat.java`, `Dolphin.java`, `Snake.java`).
- **`competitions`**: Includes classes for race management (e.g., `RaceTrack.java`, `Tournament.java`).
- **`Graphics`**: Manages the GUI, including animal images and graphical components (e.g., `CompetitionFrame.java`).
- **`mobility`**: Defines interfaces and mobility logic (e.g., `IMoveable.java`, `Mobile.java`).
- **`Olympics`**: Manages medals and scoring (`Medal.java`).

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Adding AI capabilities for automated competition management.
- **Advanced Graphics:** Implementing higher-quality animations and visuals.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Saving race data so progress is retained between sessions.
